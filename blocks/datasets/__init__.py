    """A dataset.

    Dataset classes implement the interface to a particular dataset. The
    interface consists of a number of routines to manipulate so called
    "state" objects, e.g. open, reset and close them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sources : tuple of strings, optional
        The data sources to load and return by :meth:`get_data`. By default
        all data sources are returned.

    Attributes
    ----------
    sources : tuple of strings
        The sources this dataset will provide when queried for data e.g.
        ``('features',)`` when querying only the data from MNIST.
    provides_sources : tuple of strings
        The sources this dataset *is able to* provide e.g. ``('features',
        'targets')`` for MNIST (regardless of which data the data stream
        actually requests). Any implementation of a dataset should set this
        attribute on the class (or at least before calling ``super``).
    default_iteration_scheme : :class:`.IterationScheme`, optional
        The default iteration scheme that will be used by
        :meth:`get_default_stream` to create a data stream without needing
        to specify what iteration scheme to use.

    Notes
    -----
    Datasets should only implement the interface; they are not expected to
    perform the iteration over the actual data. As such, they are
    stateless, and can be shared by different parts of the library
    simultaneously.

class InMemoryDataset(Dataset):
    """Datasets who hold all of their data in memory.

    For small datasets like e.g. MNIST it is easiest to simply load the
    entire dataset into memory. All data streams will then access the same
    data in memory.

    Notes
    -----
    Datasets which hold data in memory must be treated differently when
    serializing (saving) the training progress, because it would be very
    inefficient to save the data along with the training process. Hence,
    in-memory datasets support the :meth:`lazy_properties` decorator. This
    decorator creates a series of properties whose values won't be
    serialized; instead, their values will be reloaded (e.g. from disk) by
    the :meth:`load` function after deserializing the object.

    If the files from which the data were loaded are no longer available,
    the de-serialization could fail. Hence the reloading of these
    properties happens lazily i.e. only when the properties are requested.
    This allows the user to intervene and change the location from which
    files are loaded after de-serialization, before the :meth:`load` method
    is ever called.

    >>> from six.moves import cPickle
    >>> from blocks.datasets.mnist import MNIST
    >>> mnist = MNIST('train')
    >>> print("{:,d} KB".format(
    ...     mnist.features.nbytes / 1024)) # doctest: +SKIP
    183,750 KB
    >>> with open('mnist.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    ...     cPickle.dump(mnist, f)

    You will notice that the dumping of the dataset was relatively quick,
    because it didn't attempt to write MNIST to disk. We can now reload it,
    and if the data file has not been moved, it will be as if nothing
    happened.

    >>> with open('mnist.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    ...     mnist = cPickle.load(f)
    >>> print(mnist.features.shape)
    (60000, 784)

    However, if the data files can't be found on disk, accessing the data
    will fail.

    >>> from blocks import config
    >>> correct_path = config.data_path
    >>> config.data_path = '/non/existing/path'
    >>> with open('mnist.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    ...     mnist = cPickle.load(f)
    >>> print(mnist.features.shape) # doctest: +SKIP
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ...

    Because the loading happens lazily, we can still deserialize our
    dataset, correct the situation, and then continue.
